Risk Assessments
----------------
In the course of conducting research, you will most likely engage in activities which involve
some level of risk (e.g. working with lasers, high-pressure gas, etc.). In order to minimise
the chance of injury or damage to equipment, a *risk assessment* is completed to capture the
various hazards and corresponding safeguards associated with a particular activity. For routine
and recurring activities, such as operating the single-stage gas gun, a risk assessment will
already be in place; it is the responsibility of new researchers to read and fully
understand this document.

Existing risk assessments are posted on the DBM site:
