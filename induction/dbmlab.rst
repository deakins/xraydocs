DBM Lab
#######

The DBM lab is located within the larger Impact Engineering Laboratory on the ground floor of the IAT building. Access to the lab is controlled by a fob reader next to the mens' restroom. The DBM lab lies to the immediate right when entering the lab, behind a large ceiling-height laser curtain.

Safety indicators
=================
As an area designated for the use of high-power lasers, the DBM lab utilises a number of safety indicators to highlight the current hazard status of the laboratory. These include:

Pelmet LED strip
----------------
The curtain pelmet is decorated with a continuous run of LEDs whose color reflects the hazard status of the DBM laboratory.

The LEDs will most often be found in the following state:

- green: no hazards and general entry permitted.
- red: a hazard is present, refer to other signs (door sign, laser hazard warning sign) for entry requirements.

If the LEDs are off or displaying a different color, refer to other signage or ask the group chat for instructions.
