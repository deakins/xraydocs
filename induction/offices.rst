Offices
=======

Location
--------
Our office area is located on the 1st floor of the Institute of Advanced Technology (IAT) building, East Wing. The area hosts several research groups (Petrinic, Reed, Eakins) as well as some lab space. Access to the office area is controlled by fob to keep high-value items and sensitive documents secure.

Kitchen
-------
There is a kitchen area outside the fob access door. This is a general use area, so we must make sure to keep the space tidy and clean. This includes refilling the water and washing cups, dishes when used. The kitchen also has a number of coffee machines, however these are group specific (we don't have one - yet).

Group space
-----------
The bulk of the DBM group shares an office at the end of the main corridor, adjacent to my office and just opposite the visualisation suite. As we are growing, researchers might also occupy desks in the larger open-plan area on the other side of my office. There are some general rules to follow to be a good neighbour:
 - Use headphones
 - Take calls, meetings outside or 
 - Try to avoid eating particularly smelly foods in the office
 - Avoid distracting activities (streaming videos, playing video games, etc.)

The group also shares in the purchasing of snacks, drinks. If willing, do ask to be put on the rotation.
